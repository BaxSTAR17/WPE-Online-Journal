            Hello!, I am Baxter Gifford Bracamonte Bao-As from the section GE10A-O, studying in the degree of BS Computer Science. I was born and raised at Quezon City, while the province of my family is at Liloy City, Zamboanga Del Norte and I have been studying at Silliman University for 2 years so far ever since Grade 11 Senior High School until now, a Freshmen student in the College of Computer Studies.

            I finished my preschool, elementary and junior highschool years at St. Mary's College, Quezon City and graduated with High Honors. I was born on March 17, 2004 and currently a 19 year old Pisces male born in the year of the wooden monkey. I am baptized Roman Catholic and have always been a pure filipino citizen but I'm more comfortable in my second mother tongue, English!

            I've always been a playful and adventurous child until now and because of this, my hobbies include playing games, watching shows, listening to my favorite music, trying out new games, drawing digitally and traditionally, writing songs and even playing or making board games or card games because I've always liked making creative things like games, characters, concepts and more.
        </p>
        <p class="absolute text p4">
            My talents consists of songwriting, lyric writing, poem writing, making digital music, sound design for a play, video editing, audio editing, photo editing, pubmat editing, programming, being creative, mathematically inclined occassionally and dancing.

            <div class="star">WHY COMPUTER SCIENCE?</div>
        </div>
        <p class="absolute text p5">
            Ever since I was young, I never knew what I want to be or want to do to build my future, I've always wore a facade that I would follow my dad who is a doctor. Years passed and the pandemic came, I was really bored and I had nothing to do but go to my laptop and play games. There was one game, namely "Overwatch" that gave me my first baby steps into programming. This is because they had a feature called "Worskshop" wherein you can make your own gamemodes using programming concepts, and as I've watched tutorials on how to make my own gamemodes, I've grown inlove with the programming concepts they use to make gamemodes like the concept of variables, arrays, conditional statements and many more. Because of this, It was my first time developing a love for coding. As time passes by, when I fully decided that I will pursue programming on the second semester of Grade 12, I started advanced studying. I started with learning the basic trio of HTML, CSS, Javascript and finished online courses while doing my studies and once summer break came in, my adventure continued. I ended up learning 10 languages, C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Ruby, Rust, and Python. Because of this, it made me love coding in these different langauges and even motivated me to make my own programming language which is my goal which is why I chose Computer Science to begin with. I wanted to experience coding at its fullest potential!
