<!-- #               CCS DEVOTION>
The College of Computer Studies Devotion is one of the first events held during the Hibalag season for the CCS freshmen students. It was held on August 22, 2023, 8:00 PM at the ATA Hall organized by the Confederates Student Council. This event helps gather CCS freshmen students from different courses and unite in worship and song while listening to the wonderful sharing of our guest speaker for the devotion. I was very fortunate enough to be a part of the technical community and was able to help organize the event and its technical aspects that were essential.

I expected for our guest speaker to be able to share to us her experiences and her thoughtful advices that she could give to us students in the College of Computer Studies and I am very glad my expectations of these were met. The activity surprised me when there was apparantly free food after the devotion which was very convenient at the time because it was at the morning. The best part of the event is how I got to be behind the scenes and got to help with the technical difficulties of the event.

The event gave me insights from our speaker as well as learnings but since this was my first event as a member of the technical committee, I was also able to learn more about my duties and my responsibilities for not just events like the devotion but other essential ones especially during the Hibalag season. These learnings can be applied to my future as I might need these learnings to further go to my goal.

Because of this event, I am able to help organize and experience a proper devotion with my fellow CCS batchmates 

<!-- #               JESUS AND US, TOGETHER CHILDREN'S SUNDAY>
Jesus and us, together is a religious event held on Children's Sunday to empower youth and strengthen the campaign and advocacy for loving children and helping them grow and develop in a healthy way. It was held on September 10, 2023, 4:00 PM at the SU church. Majority of the people attended were dormers including me and the performers for the singing numbers during the mass were children.

The activity was successful in promoting the importance and safety of the youth and I even liked how the event gave children a chance to be a part of the mass as the readers of the gospel or the scriptural texts and the performance numbers. The highlights of this event was whenever the children participants got a time to shine because they did their part well and was able to execute it for the mass.

The event gave me new perspectives and insights on how we should take care and give importance to children alike as they can grow to become influential ones in the future and can have the power to change the world. This event's advocacy is a great benefit for us to use in order to understand the youth more and accept them as they grow. I'd be more than willing to participate in another event like this again if I had a chance because I support the youth today that will make a difference tomorrow.

Because of this mass, I am happier and more thoughtful in welcoming and helping children through the smallest of deeds everyday.

<!-- #               iDOLTZ ACQUAINTANCE DEVOTION>
The iDoltz Acquaintance Devotion is a mass dedicated to the iDoltz or Acquaintance Party event for the dormers in Doltz Hall. It happened on September 24, 2023, 5:00 PM at the frontyard of Doltz Hall dormitory. Although the event was optional and not mandatory, I still decided to take part in the event as a resident of Doltz Hall to create memories and experience the mass together with my fellow dormers.

The devotion set off a good start for the acquaintance party as they sanctified and taught us with great scriptures and the like. Fortunately enough, my roommate also got a role in the devotion which is to read the scriptural passage and he was also able to deliver it very well. The only sad part of the event was the fact that it was raining and we had to stay under canopies for the rest of the mass.

The devotion was able to give me new insights especially from the new scriptural passage for today. It also helped me see the importance of the acquaintance party and how it's essential for the residents of Doltz Hall. I'd go to any devotion like this before any event to ready myself spiritually.

Because of this devotion, I am able to take part in the acquaintance party through a good start with my fellow dormers.

<!-- #               DORMITORY MIDWEEK SERVICE>
The dormitory midweek service is a eucharistic celebration for all dormers in Silliman University. It occurred on September 27, 2923, 6:00 PM at the SU Church. It is held to discuss and reflect on what it's like and how it is being a dormer in Silliman University. As a resident of Doltz Hall, I was able to take part in this optional event with other dormers from different dorms.

The service went well as usual and it gave us a chance to reflect and look back on the experience we've gained and the memories we've created as a dormer. I was also shocked at the fact that there were 2 dormers that were able to give their testimonies during the mass and share to the people their experience and their development made possible with the dormitory life in Silliman University. The best parts were definitely the testimonies of the fellow dormers that were inspiring and impactful.

The service motivated me to cherish my dorm life and share it with everyone else, as this was the insight and learning I gained from this mass. As a resident of a dormer, I can proudly say that this can have a lot of benefits not only for dormers but also for aspiring dormers and we can always spread and preach these learnings too so that other people would be convinced.

Because of this service, I am aspiring to empower and be proud of my reputation as a dormer and try my full best to survive being one.

<!-- #               DOLTZ HALL DEVOTION>
The Doltz Hall Devotion is a devotion that is catered for the residents of Doltz Hall, it was the only devotion held for the month of October. It was held on October 10, 2023, 7:00 PM at the Mess Hall or also known as the cafeteria between Larena and Doltz Hall. The devotion is for the residents of Doltz Hall including me to connect with one another and engage in a unified reflection over our survival as a dormer for the school year.

The devotion pushed through and it was able to get us dormers to sing songs together, pray together and reminisce the history of the dormitory. We even had a guest speaker to guide us and share to us her experiences and her challenges. I was also very shocked once our guest speaker told us that she was also from CCS before, the same college I am in. From there, she was able to share to us her experience being a CCS student as well and how it was hard to manage back then especially with the buggy floppy disks as she said so I consider this to be the best part of the event.

The devotion gave me a lot of new insights and perspectives especially from our guest speakers' experiences and sharings on how to cope with stress, how to cope with a new environment such as the dorms and college, and how to get proper rest and balance of things. These learnings and useful advices can be applied in our daily lives especially because we are going through college and we are residing in a home away from our actual home.

Because of this devotion, I feel more devoted and welcome in my dorm and I am more determined to strive my best in to overcoming my hardships while being a dormer.

<!-- #               FRESHMEN TREAT FELLOWSHIP: ALL OF US ARE SAVED>
The Freshmen Treat Fellowship subtitled "All of us are saved" is a fellowship service for freshmen students from Silliman University. It was held on November 11, 2023, 4:00 PM at the Magdamo Hall specifically in the Mercedes Room. It was held to emphasize and empower a bible verse that can connect us, guide our life, and make us united through sharing, discussing and etc. As a freshmen student, and a student of Ma'am Lily Apura, one of the organizers of the event, I was able to participate in it along with my other classmates.

The event exceeded my expectations as I got to enjoy the games and I got to befriend new people and got to share to them my experiences, my challenges and my opinions. The activity took me aback with its games that helped us meet brand new people and we were able to share many things like secrets, fears and past experences. Because of this, I consider the games to be the best part of the event as it makes us more closer to each other.

The event's bible verse which is Euphesians 5:8 tells us that we are children of light therefore we should walk and live a path of light with no darkness. This is the main learning and insight that the event was all about and this scriptural passage can be very useful in our daily lives. It even gives us the great benefit of spreading this bible verse and placing it in our lives to influence other people and children alike.

Because of this fellowship, I am able to share with more people and improve my life of light based on the bible verse.

<!-- #               GALILEAN FELLOWSHIP 2023>
The Galilean Fellowship Service 2023 is a fellowship service held on November 21, 2023, 5:00 PM at the SU Church for the whole Silliman University. The goal of this event is to promote and empower the UCLEM's theme while connecting with other people at the event who had effort in making their banners. Our group for CHS was also able to make our banner and with them, I was able to become part of the event.

The event went very well and the participants and people that made their banners shocked me as their banners were very creative and outstanding even though it was made in just 4 days or less. The creativity of these banners were truly the highlight of this event and also the free snacks. The sad part about this event is that we weren't even able to get more pictures and experience more of the event because the event was cut short due to the very heavy raining that poured over the field.

The event taught us the beauty and outcome of perfect teamwork and how everybody is willing to put effort and hardwork into their banner even if it just got destroyed from the rainstorm. As these banners promote the theme of UCLEM, which is "Embracing God's GIFT(Great Incredible Favor Today), it was able to show to us the meaning and potential of its theme and topic and with this, it can even be applied in our lives. 

Because of this fellowship service, I am more willing to empower and emphasize the importance of church events through my creativity just like with these banners.

<!-- #               UCLEM CCS MIDWEEK WORSHIP>
The UCLEM Midweek Worship Service is a religious mass for certain college departments during the midweek to commemorate the University Christian Life Emphasis Month. It occurred on November 22, 2023, 6:30 PM at the SU Church on a Wednesday because it is a midweek service. It is also held to gather students from different colleges to connect and unite them spiritually and so that they can see the purpose of UCLEM. Even though the event wasn't required, I still took part in the event even as a CCS student to embrace the essence of UCLEM.

The worship went very well and normally like a regular mass. I felt a sense of unity and connection with my collegemates as the CCS polo shirt was worn to indicate that were from the same college. Because of this, I felt more welcome and united with my collegemates. The mass also had a speaker that was able to share to us the essence of UCLEM and our status to God himself as "children of God" and that alone is very important.

As the event goes on, our speaker was able to teach us insights about how we are sinners that are saved by Jesus which grants us the title or status of being "adopted children of God". With this learning alone, we can teach and preach it to other people so that they'd know the great honor and sacrifice Jesus had to make for us to become adopted children of God.

Because of this midweek worship, I am knowledgable now of the true essence and meaning of UCLEM for the people and how we can truly be "children of God".
