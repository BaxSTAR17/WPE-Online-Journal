<!-- #               CONFEDERATES COLLABORATIVE EVENT>
The Confederates Collaborative Event is an activity held for CCS students to help manage and prepare for the Parada. The event was held at any time within the day of August 27, 2023 at the UCS Lobby. It welcomes all CCS students alike and welcomes them so that the aesthetics committee can have more manpower and so that we would be able to get the job done faster in no time. As a dancer in the parada, on the break of my practice, I was able to help and extend service to my fellow collegemates and the aesthetic committee so that their workload can be decreased.

I genuinely enjoyed and liked this activity because it promotes unity and cooperation with one another until the teamwork is enough to get the task done. We were all doing our little tasks but these small tasks can offer a big help especially in a setting with a lot of manpower. The best parts of the event is definitely talking and still having fun with one another while working and listening to music while it motivates us to work more.

The event motivated us in a way that it pushes us to be closer and connected to each other. I got to strengthen a lot of my bonds that day which made me like the event even more and it even showed me the importance of friends and having someone to help you in your doings. This event may be tiring but we were able to leave the event with the thought that we can rely on each other healthily and thats a great benefit.

Because of this event, I am more open and cooperative for my fellow batchmates and college mates because this event taught me the importance of camaraderie and teamwork.

<!-- #               COMMUNITY MURAL>
The Community Mural is a community event held by DAKILA and Active Vista on September 29, 2023 near the Eleven Monkeys Store wherein any people from all accross dumaguete are able to contribute to this community mural so that we can have a unified and symbolistic community mural filled with concepts and ideas sprung from the people's mind and experiences. This event was made by and for the community, and as part of the community in Dumaguete City, myself, I decided to go to the mural and see what it has to offer.

The community mural exceeded my expectations as it was bursting with symbolical messages and was painted with great skill and effort and I really have to praise the community for making such a wonderful mural. Even though the mural is very small and it's not that noticable, the creativity and the concepts portrayed in the mural are crucially important and beautiful.

This community event influenced me to express myself more publicly whether it be for my opinions, for my perspectives or for my stands and beliefs, I would still want to practice expressing myself with the help of this event. A lot of the mini portions of the mural can actually teach and give important messages and learnings, and through this we can apply these in our lives and get reminded of it whenever we pass by the mural and for me, that is an important advantage and benefit.

Because of this event, I feel a lot happy knowing that there are a lot of people that are creative but are also willing to stand up for what they think is right.

<!-- #               SIGN ME UP: DEAF CULTURE AND A WAY OF LIFE>
The Sign Me Up: Deaf Culture and a Way of life is a community engagement event that reaches out to the deaf community and also promotes and commemorates international sign language day, a holiday celebrating one of the most common mediums of communication for deaf or mute people. The event was held on October 14, 2023, 10:00 AM at the PEP Room of the Oriental Hall. The event was open to all students of different colleges so that a lot of people would experience what its like communicating and cooperating with the deaf community.

The event went over my expectations and I enjoyed it more than I expected because it was filled with lots of interactive and fun games and even sharing that helped us connect with our deaf guests. Everyone was really enjoying their time especially our deaf guests that facilitated these games themselves. One of the best parts of the activity is the last portion of the event where we get to ask questions personally to one of our guests like an open forum about sign language and the deaf community while a translator would translate our questions.

The activity taught us some useful sign language actions and keywords that would help us communicate in the smallest ways to other deaf people and can encourage us to even learn the whole vocabulary of sign language. With these learnings, I can apply this in my future whenever I encounter a deaf or mute person so that there won't be any communication barriers that would hinder us and that's a big benefit.

Because of this event, I am more knowledgable of sign language and aware of the detrimental situations and challenges deaf people have to face to just communicate.

<!-- #               LOCAL FARMERS' TABO>
The Local Farmers' Tabo is an agricultural fair event that promotes and helps our local farmers to sell their products to recognize and pay them for their hardwork. The event occurred on October 28, 2023, 8:00 AM at Guy Hall. The event was open to the entire university and everyone was free to buy whatever from our local farmers. As a student of Silliman University, I was more than willing to go to this event and buy what they have to offer because our local products should be recognized.

The event was successful and the local farmers were able to have their products sold well. The prices were also very cheap and negotiable, it was a perfect agricultural fair event. One of the stalls even sell a lot of my favorite fruits that I miss eating back in my hometown. The sellers ere also very friendly and welcoming and they really serve as the highlight of this event.

This event alone can teach us and influence us to explore and unravel more of our local products other than just dwelling with foreign products. It can give us the insight that these farmers are trying to make a living out of their hardwork and is trying to gain the best outcome from their hardwork and being able to buy from them feels like I've helped them in many ways more than one.

Because of this event, I am further determined to give more attention to local products and even promote these to other people especially of my own country.
