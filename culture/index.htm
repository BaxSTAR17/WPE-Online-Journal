                    Freshie walk is an event held in Silliman University every school year to welcome the freshmen students and to commemorate the fact that they are now in college, and it eventually became a staple in Silliman Culture for this event to occur. The walk started from around the Ariniego Art Gallery until the Amphitheater and around a thousand freshies were able to participate in the event as they all fill up the entire roads and streets of the Silliman Campus. The event started at August 17, 2023, 2 PM and lasted until late afternoon under bright sunlight. My role was a regular freshmen student that walked with my batch.

                <p class="paragraph cardB">
                    My expectations for this event were for it to be crowdy, hot, and chaotic as there would be so many students from every course there is. At the actual event, although it was hot, the walk was actually pretty successful, and I was even able to make some new friends along the way as I was walking with other people in my batch and in my course that I haven’t talked to so it was refreshing because at least I talked to someone new and not the people I’m used to talking to. The best parts of the event were when we were all sitting at the Amphitheater, and we were able to watch performances and participate in a short devotion. The worst part that I’d have to admit during the event was definitely having to walk despite the sunny weather.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    The program influenced me in a way to experience more camaraderie and unity as one with all of the other freshmen that are very diverse in culture, personality and looks. I learned and felt the importance of having to experience even the smallest of things together with other people at the same place and time because it feels surreal and amazing to just feel the sonder around you as you tread your way on the stones and grounds of Silliman.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardD">
                    Because of this event, I am more connected and united to my freshmen batch of schoolyear 2023-2024 and I feel that I can survive college with a lot of them beside me.

                    The Buglasan Festival Parade is an event held as part of Dumaguete City’s tradition and culture. It occurred on October 14, 2023, 2:00 PM and it concluded in the late afternoon. The parade started from the streets of Portal West and the whole parade stretched onto the farther parts of the street. The people that participated in the event were different organizations, schools, bands, influencers and more as they wear their distinct outfits that make them stand out and spread their advocacy and message throughout the streets of Dumaguete City. My role in the event was just a spectator from the campus of Silliman University and I was there to witness the great performances of different organizations and of course, of our very own SU Band.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardB">
                    The activity surprised me on how much people and organizations were able to walk on the parade since I initially thought that it would be consisted of a few universities and groups, but they included a lot of people in the whole parade walk, to the point that even actors and stars were included in the walk, and it was a pleasure to witness all of it. The best part of the activity was the fact that I was able to witness the parade ever since it started walking. The hardest part of the event was the fact that it was very crowdy and it was hard to get a clear and good view of everything.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    I was able to see a lot of organizations that are there to spread their advocacy in the parade but the one that stuck to my head the most and the one where I got to have a lot of realizations was when there were people in the parade that had outfits made to represent and empower indigenous people and tribes. At that part of the event, I was able to realize the dying reputation of these indigenous people and how they aren’t given enough support and attention, but with this event, it helps let people aware that they still thrive in this country and all we need to do is respect and acknowledge them.

                <p class="paragraph cardD">
                    Because of this event, I am able to recognize and praise a lot of organizations and groups that were able to showcase their message, performance and presence successfully on the streets of Dumaguete City.

                    The College of Computer Studies Acquanitance Party  is an event organized by the Confederates Student Council for students of the college and it was held as part of our culture as a college in Silliman University to bring us closer to one another and form greater bonds between all of us in the college so that we may feel like a united family striving through and through. It was held at the Silliman University Elementary Gym on September 29, 2023, 6:00 PM until 9:00 PM. People from all levels in the college were able to attend the event including the faculty and teachers of the college. As a member of the technical committee, I was able to help with the setting up of the event and some of the decorations to aid the Aesthetics Committee.

                <p class="paragraph cardB">
                    The event strongly met my expectations, and it was really fun to bond with my college mates and experience the same moment with all of them. The activity surprised me with its games, performances and even the quirky and unique outfits of a lot of people who organized or attended the event. The best parts of the event were the performances and the bountiful food we were able to consume during the event. There weren’t any hard parts of the event, I just totally enjoyed the entire timeframe of everything on that day.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    The program helped me strengthen my unity more with the college and helped me live comfortably in the vast diversity of people that were present. I made new memories and moments that are cherished until today. The real benefit of this activity is the fact that it could help you realize that you’re not alone and that everybody would want to have fun with you too, even for just a day. I would attend this event again if ever there was another chance.

                <p class="paragraph cardD">
                    Because of this event, I am able to cherish and give importance to much more memories and bonds that were made so far in my stay in the college.

                    Parada Sillimania 2023 is another event in the Silliman University Founder’s Day timeframe and it is the moment where different colleges from the university walk and parade the streets while each are promoting their own messages, culture and themes to the city with their dances, mascots, music and banners. The people who walked in the parade can vary from normal freshmen students to even higher years of the college and a lot of people were there to also witness it on the streets of Dumaguete City. My role in the activity was actually an important one and it’s the fact that I got to be a part of the dancers for both the Parada and the Dance Showdown.

                <p class="paragraph cardB">
                    My initial expectations for this were that we would be having difficulty in preparing an extravagant performance. Although, as time went on, all of us dancers, the aesthetic committee and the rest of the college were able to be united and  we felt like a family. Every day of practice until the final performance was the best parts of this event. The hardest parts in the event were of course when things don’t go well for our days of practice in terms of weather especially at the day of the performance where at the time we were doing our blockings and at the time of the actual performance, it rained very hard but we were able to go through it and bring a splendid performance.

                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    This event gave me the strongest sense of camaraderie and teamwork and it taught me why it is essential. It also helped set a steppingstone for me to get to know more of my college batchmates and befriend a lot of people. We were also able to enhance and improve our dancing skills throughout all our practices. The benefits that I got with this event was that it even helped serve as a physical and social workout that I didn’t know I ever needed. Definitely, when the opportunity strikes again to participate in this event, I will take part in it yet again.

                    Mr. Hibalag 2023 is also an event conducted during the HIbalag season. Just like Miss Silliman 2023, it is a competition between participants representing different colleges and promoting different advocacies, the difference is that the participants are male this time around. It was held at Hibalag grounds on August 27, 2023, 8:00 PM and there were many people that watched this event that are not even from Silliman University because Hibalag was open to all. The goal of this event is very similar to Miss Silliman, but it showcases more cultural awareness and culture-related advocacies.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardB">
                    My initial expectations for this event were that it’s going to be just like Miss Silliman, and it would not be so different from each other. However, I was taken aback after seeing how the contest has their differences and it stood out from other pageants or competitions out there. There were still Q&A portions where they get to express their beautiful answers but the main highlight for me in this event were the outfits. This is because the various different outfits they wore hold traditional and cultural meanings and some of them even empower and signify Philippine culture from all around the country. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    The competition encouraged me to be more thoughtful and aware of these cultural things in our country and help empower them so that they won’t die out in future generations. They were also a great role model of self-confidence and courage as they were very confident and strong about their answers and claims during the Q&A portions. If there was any activity like this one, I would totally go and watch it and have the same fun I had during this event.

                <p class="paragraph cardD">
                    Because of this event, I am more enlightened and aware of different cultures and how they can be represented and showcased in any way shape or form.

                    Miss Silliman 2023 is an annual event held by Silliman University ever since the early 1940s and it has become one of the oldest running events for women around the world and it still runs until today as it's a very important in the culture of the school. It was held on August 26, 2023, 6:00 PM at the Macias Sports Complex. There were people from multiple colleges that attended the event just to support their representatives. The goal of this event is like any other beauty pageant where women participants, representing a course, are there to compete in the looks of their outfits, the presence and aura of their demeanor, the confidence and the thought-provoking answers they can give. My role for this event is just part of the audience while I cheer for the contestants.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardB">
                    The program exceeded my expectations as everything was going into place, the decorations, the effects, the outfits and even the answers of the contestants during the Q&A portions, it was all going well, and I couldn’t have asked for more. Even though my college didn’t have a representative, that didn’t stop from me and my other batchmates to enjoy the show. The best parts of the activity were the Q&A portions as it keeps me intrigued the most. Although, I had to admit that there were hard decisions I had to make because the event keeps on being delayed at the final part and it was getting too late so at around 11:30, I had to leave because of it and the fact that I couldn’t stay for long. 
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    The Miss Silliman pageant held a lot of different learnings and insights that were delivered by the contestants and is even portrayed by their outfits. Their outfits each hold different significant meanings with some similarly mirroring each other but they had their own ways to stand out from the rest of their fellow contestants. A lot of the learnings that they give can all be applied and considered in our day-to-day lives and can even be influential in our decisions and actions.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardD">
                    Because of this activity, I am amazed by the passion and presence of the contestants of the event and the execution of everything and it was all truly phenomenal.

                    The International Food Fest was also held during the Hibalag season within the Silliman University Founder’s Day timeframe at August 19, 2023 and it was open at around lunchtime until late afternoon. The goal and objective of this event and sale was to spread awareness and showcase the diversity and beauty of the cuisine and dishes made in other cultures or people coming from foreign cultures which promotes unity in diversity and the exposure to the different cultures outside the Philippines. Me and my friends’ role in the activity was to buy some of what they were selling, spread the word and enjoy our time at the sale.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardB">
                    I initially thought that the event would hold a lot of stands but when me and my friends got there, we were surprised that there were only around 2 stands for the sale, but I believe it increased on the future days we couldn’t go. Nonetheless, we still got to buy one of the snacks, which was Macha ice cream, even though it was only a singular snack but since it was in a fairly sized cup, me and my friends were able to share it with each other. The hardest part of the event was to find more stands for the sale, but it was alright because we got to pick a really good snack.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    The event got to influence our views on the cuisines of other cultures just by trying out one of the snacks and passing by the other stand. It was able to enlighten us about how other cultures and other countries are passionate on food as we are in our own country and the food on these different cultures are surely unique and it was something we don’t just see anywhere just like the Macha ice cream. A lot of benefits relating to to cultural knowledge and awareness about other cuisines and helps pave way for an open mind.

                    Silliman Parade Of Lights is an event that is held during Hibalag 2023 within the duration of the Silliman University Founder’s Day Celebration. It occurred at Aug. 19, 2023, at around late night. The people and some of the children that participated at the parade has such colorful, creative and bright outfits that exceedingly shine and stand out in the nighttime. The event was held not only to make people stuck in awe but also to represent different kinds of animals and symbolisms with their outfits. Although It was at the nighttime, I was able to watch the parade as it was nearing it’s end at the Hibalag grounds. The Silliman Parade of Lights is a cultural event that is held whenever Hibalag is right around the corner and it can even portray a lot of cultural diversity with the design and how the participants make their outfits, including the materials and the specific color of lights they use in the parade.

                    My expectations of this event that only people who are professional at experiencing parades were the ones doing the parade walk but I was surprised that even children can participate in the event, and they were even walking with their parents who are also covered in lights as well. The execution of the different outfits and lights showcased at the parade was the best part of the event and the saddest part was the fact that I couldn’t see the parade at its very start but at the very least I still caught up to it at the end.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph cardC">
                    The parade was able to enlighten me both figuratively and literally about the diversity of creativity and passion that was poured into this parade alone. Where even children get to play with lights while still participating in the parade with their happy smiles and joyful demeanor. The benefits that I gained in this event was the fact that I was able to enjoy a really beautiful showcase and if there’s another chance again, I would totally watch the parade again in the future.
