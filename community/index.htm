                <p>The Annual American Thanksgiving Celebration organized by Silliman University and the SU International Student Center is an event to acknowledge thanksgiving and to engage and provide service to our fellow American friends and Alumni in the Silliman Community. It occurred on November 22, 2023, , 9:00 AM at the Silliman University Library (Gym). The spealers were Dr. Rozzano Locsin and Rev. Jonathan R. Pia and their audience were us Sillimanians, the International students and the alumnis of Silliman. </p>
                <p>The activity helped us embrace the foreign holiday of Thanksgiving and helping us connect and unite with our fellow American Students and Silliman Alumnis through paying tribute to them with this event especially through genuine messages, service and especially through eating a bountiful meal with them all. The best parts of this event were definitely the short Sillimanian games and trivia that helped strengthen our bond even more.</p>
                <p>The event made us students realize the importance and essence of Thanksgiving despite it not being celebrated in the Philippines and that is it helps connect and unite us all and also helps us to become thankful for the many blessings that came and has yet to come for all of us. Because of this event, we even got to collectively meet other alumnis more and american sillimanians which helps us to become more open and welcoming to them.</p>
                <p>Because of this celebration, I am able to experience community engagement activities with my fellow American Sillimanians and Alumnis which strengthens our bond.</p>

                <p>The Sto. Nino Orphanage White Gift Donation and Christmas Card Making is an event organized through our subject, GE10, to give us the chance to offer relief goods and necessities for the youth present in the Sto. Nino Orphanage and greet them a merry christmas. The white gift wrapping and christmas card making took place on December 6, 2023, 11:30 AM at the ATA Hall of the UCS Building. As a member of my group in GE10, me and my group were more than happy to be able to make christmas cards and white gifts for the youth at the Orphanage. </p>
                <p>As a member of the group, I was able to bring my contribution to the white gifts which were toothpaste, and also my contribution for the christmas card making which were providing scissors and coloring materials like markers. It was rather heartwarming and fun making as a group as we were cooperating with each other actively and we were able to laugh and smile together while doing so and that's what made this event memorable.</p>
                <p>After me and my group were done with the tasks and everything, I was able to realize how our chemistry and teamwork can lead us a long way and how it can even help out other people through our smallest efforts and sacrifices like providing them with sufficient goods and necessities that can help give them a spark of happiness and hope. This event even influenced us as a group to make our messages inside our christmas card as genuine as possible which helps us learn to be very genuine and loving.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more than satisfied with me and my group's work and how our hardwork would help the youth at the Orphanage live their lives with hope and knowledge that there are people that care for them dearly.</p>

                <p>The Local Farmers' Tabo is an agricultural fair event that promotes and helps our local farmers to sell their products to recognize and pay them for their hardwork. The event occurred on October 28, 2023, 8:00 AM at Guy Hall. The event was open to the entire university and everyone was free to buy whatever from our local farmers. As a student of Silliman University, I was more than willing to go to this event and buy what they have to offer because our local products should be recognized.</p>
                <p>The event was successful and the local farmers were able to have their products sold well. The prices were also very cheap and negotiable, it was a perfect agricultural fair event. One of the stalls even sell a lot of my favorite fruits that I miss eating back in my hometown. The sellers ere also very friendly and welcoming and they really serve as the highlight of this event.</p>
                <p>This event alone can teach us and influence us to explore and unravel more of our local products other than just dwelling with foreign products. It can give us the insight that these farmers are trying to make a living out of their hardwork and is trying to gain the best outcome from their hardwork and being able to buy from them feels like I've helped them in many ways more than one.</p>
                <p>Because of this event, I am further determined to give more attention to local products and even promote these to other people especially of my own country.</p>

                <p>The Sign Me Up: Deaf Culture and a Way of life is a community engagement event that reaches out to the deaf community and also promotes and commemorates international sign language day, a holiday celebrating one of the most common mediums of communication for deaf or mute people. The event was held on October 14, 2023, 10:00 AM at the PEP Room of the Oriental Hall. The event was open to all students of different colleges so that a lot of people would experience what its like communicating and cooperating with the deaf community.</p>
                <p>The event went over my expectations and I enjoyed it more than I expected because it was filled with lots of interactive and fun games and even sharing that helped us connect with our deaf guests. Everyone was really enjoying their time especially our deaf guests that facilitated these games themselves. One of the best parts of the activity is the last portion of the event where we get to ask questions personally to one of our guests like an open forum about sign language and the deaf community while a translator would translate our questions.</p>
                <p>The activity taught us some useful sign language actions and keywords that would help us communicate in the smallest ways to other deaf people and can encourage us to even learn the whole vocabulary of sign language. With these learnings, I can apply this in my future whenever I encounter a deaf or mute person so that there won't be any communication barriers that would hinder us and that's a big benefit.</p>
                <p>Because of this event, I am more knowledgable of sign language and aware of the detrimental situations and challenges deaf people have to face to just communicate.</p>

                <p>The Confederates Collaborative Event is an activity held for CCS students to help manage and prepare for the Parada. The event was held at any time within the day of August 27, 2023 at the UCS Lobby. It welcomes all CCS students alike and welcomes them so that the aesthetics committee can have more manpower and so that we would be able to get the job done faster in no time. As a dancer in the parada, on the break of my practice, I was able to help and extend service to my fellow collegemates and the aesthetic committee so that their workload can be decreased.</p>
                <p>I genuinely enjoyed and liked this activity because it promotes unity and cooperation with one another until the teamwork is enough to get the task done. We were all doing our little tasks but these small tasks can offer a big help especially in a setting with a lot of manpower. The best parts of the event is definitely talking and still having fun with one another while working and listening to music while it motivates us to work more.</p>
                <p>The event motivated us in a way that it pushes us to be closer and connected to each other. I got to strengthen a lot of my bonds that day which made me like the event even more and it even showed me the importance of friends and having someone to help you in your doings. This event may be tiring but we were able to leave the event with the thought that we can rely on each other healthily and thats a great benefit.</p>
                <p>Because of this event, I am more open and cooperative for my fellow batchmates and college mates because this event taught me the importance of camaraderie and teamwork.</p>

                <p>The Community Mural is a community event held by DAKILA and Active Vista on September 29, 2023 near the Eleven Monkeys Store wherein any people from all accross dumaguete are able to contribute to this community mural so that we can have a unified and symbolistic community mural filled with concepts and ideas sprung from the people's mind and experiences. This event was made by and for the community, and as part of the community in Dumaguete City, myself, I decided to go to the mural and see what it has to offer.</p>
                <p>The community mural exceeded my expectations as it was bursting with symbolical messages and was painted with great skill and effort and I really have to praise the community for making such a wonderful mural. Even though the mural is very small and it's not that noticable, the creativity and the concepts portrayed in the mural are crucially important and beautiful.</p>
                <p>This community event influenced me to express myself more publicly whether it be for my opinions, for my perspectives or for my stands and beliefs, I would still want to practice expressing myself with the help of this event. A lot of the mini portions of the mural can actually teach and give important messages and learnings, and through this we can apply these in our lives and get reminded of it whenever we pass by the mural and for me, that is an important advantage and benefit.</p>
                <p>Because of this event, I feel a lot happy knowing that there are a lot of people that are creative but are also willing to stand up for what they think is right.</p>

                <p>The PEP Christmas Outreach is a Fellowship Sunrise Service and Gift-giving outreach event organized by the Guidance and Testing Division, Office of Student Services, and Silliman University to offer goods and sacks of rice to our fellow hardworking safety and security guards of Silliman University. This event occurred on December 6, 2023, 5:30 AM at the Amphitheatre. As a freshmen student that is part of the PEP section B6, me and my group were more than thankful to be able to have the chance to help buy rice and offer it to our fellow guards.</p>
                <p>The event started at the very early time of sunrise and a lot of us just woke up for this event, but nonetheless, the event started with a hopeful and spiritualistic start with the mass and the speaker's message that was impactful. The giving of rice to each and every security guard of SIlliman University was also very heartwarming as we can see their smiles very clearly once they receive the rice. The zumba dance portions were also a very entertaining part of the event.</p>
                <p>This sunrise service gave me the chance to help and care for our fellow security guards in return for their hard work to keep us safe. Because of this, we, PEP students, were able to collectively realize how we can connect to our security guards more and more with this event. The event even became more genuine as our group were the ones able to provide the rice and give it to the security guards ourselves and because of this, we are determined to do more like this.</p>
                <p>Because of this outreach, I become more motivated to give others meaningful gifts as my special way of saying thank you for this Christmas.</p>

                <p>The Sponsor's Corner is a fundraising event organized by the freshmen ROTC Sponsors to financially help the less fortunate and poverty by gaining funds through selling affordable and simple treats and snacks to Silliman students. This event was held on November 23, 2023, 8:00 AM at the Ausejo Hall Nature Area and went on until December 7, 2023. As a member of the HQ company in ROTC, I wanted to support our sponsors and bought our favorite snacks from them to help a cause.</p>
                <p>I really love how they accomodate their customers and how good the quality of their simple snacks are. I was also very satisfied of their menu as it contains my favorite sweets, treats and drinks like Blue Lemonade, Mango Tapioca, Macaroons and even Crinkles and I believe that's what made their corner very special from other stores. The only sad part is the fact that there would be times that some treats would be sold out already just like the Crinkles.</p>
                <p>Even though the event got to give me good food and drinks, it still gave me happiness and relief that through paying for these treats, I got to help out for a cause and I got to contribute for the sake of others. With this, I am further motivated to do more with the smallest of actions just like with this one to help for the greater good and that's the best benefit I gained from this event.</p>
                <p>Because of this event, I got to help the less fortunate in many more ways than one because this activity gave me the opportunity to do so.</p>
