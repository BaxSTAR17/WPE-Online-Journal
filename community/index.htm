                <p>The Annual American Thanksgiving Celebration organized by Silliman University and the SU International Student Center is an event to acknowledge thanksgiving and to engage and provide service to our fellow American friends and Alumni in the Silliman Community. It occurred on November 22, 2023, , 9:00 AM at the Silliman University Library (Gym). The spealers were Dr. Rozzano Locsin and Rev. Jonathan R. Pia and their audience were us Sillimanians, the International students and the alumnis of Silliman. </p>
                <p>The activity helped us embrace the foreign holiday of Thanksgiving and helping us connect and unite with our fellow American Students and Silliman Alumnis through paying tribute to them with this event especially through genuine messages, service and especially through eating a bountiful meal with them all. The best parts of this event were definitely the short Sillimanian games and trivia that helped strengthen our bond even more.</p>
                <p>The event made us students realize the importance and essence of Thanksgiving despite it not being celebrated in the Philippines and that is it helps connect and unite us all and also helps us to become thankful for the many blessings that came and has yet to come for all of us. Because of this event, we even got to collectively meet other alumnis more and american sillimanians which helps us to become more open and welcoming to them.</p>
                <p>Because of this celebration, I am able to experience community engagement activities with my fellow American Sillimanians and Alumnis which strengthens our bond.</p>

                <p>The Sto. Nino Orphanage White Gift Donation and Christmas Card Making is an event organized through our subject, GE10, to give us the chance to offer relief goods and necessities for the youth present in the Sto. Nino Orphanage and greet them a merry christmas. The white gift wrapping and christmas card making took place on December 6, 2023, 11:30 AM at the ATA Hall of the UCS Building. As a member of my group in GE10, me and my group were more than happy to be able to make christmas cards and white gifts for the youth at the Orphanage. </p>
                <p>As a member of the group, I was able to bring my contribution to the white gifts which were toothpaste, and also my contribution for the christmas card making which were providing scissors and coloring materials like markers. It was rather heartwarming and fun making as a group as we were cooperating with each other actively and we were able to laugh and smile together while doing so and that's what made this event memorable.</p>
                <p>After me and my group were done with the tasks and everything, I was able to realize how our chemistry and teamwork can lead us a long way and how it can even help out other people through our smallest efforts and sacrifices like providing them with sufficient goods and necessities that can help give them a spark of happiness and hope. This event even influenced us as a group to make our messages inside our christmas card as genuine as possible which helps us learn to be very genuine and loving.</p>
                <p>Because of this activity, I am more than satisfied with me and my group's work and how our hardwork would help the youth at the Orphanage live their lives with hope and knowledge that there are people that care for them dearly.</p>
