                <p>The Silliman University Founder's Day Invitational Swimming Competition is an event held during the Founder's Day period wherein Silliman invites swimmers from different outside schools and groups to compete and battle it out. It was held on August 18, 2023, 2:30 PM at the Silliman University Pool near the Gymnasium. There were many participants and swimmers both boys and girls from different school levels from high school until college. In the event, I was just part of the very crowdy audience, and I was able to get a good view of everything in the competition.</p>

            <div class="bubble paragraph bub2" style="--order: 5">
                <p>My expectations for this event were met as the swimmers swam really well, I even got to take a video of someone that swam from the start to the end in just around 10 seconds and that's a great record already. The activity surprised me on how much swimmers were swimming throughout the whole event, it felt like the contestants were never ending as countless of them swim on the pool. The event showcased one of the best swimmers in my eyes and that is the highlight for me in this event.</p>

                <p>This event encouraged me to train more in swimming and try harder as I am not a good swimmer myself. I failed my swimming classes before when I was still young but seeing this competition, it has given me a new insight that I should try to go back into swimming again. You can say that the contestants really inspired me with their swimming prowess, skills, and motivation to keep on swimming until the end even if they couldn't hold their breath for long.</p>

                <p class="ability desc ab1">The CCS Mobile Legends Tournament is an event organized by the Confederates Student Council to gather Mobile Legends Players in the College of Computer Studies to battle it out and compete in this tournament. The day of the Finals which was held on August 23, 2023, 9:00 AM at the ATA Hall was the only day I got to attend for the tournament. My role in this activity was to help with the technical handling of the tournament as a member of the technical committee like the livestreaming and managing the matches.</p>
                <p class="ability desc ab2">The tournament went very well as the commentating and the livestreaming were made possible through the use of my phone as it was capable to stream the match live. The best part about the activity was how I could just spectate over the entire match with my phone as the tournament goes and it was satisfying to see all of them do their thing. The only sad part I could say about the event is how I got excused for half of the event for my practices for Parada Sillimania</p>
                <p class="ability desc ab3">I was never a fan or a consistent player of Mobile Legends, but after the event it encouraged me to play the game. It also gave me different perspectives and different ways players were able to achieve teamwork and cooperation with each other and all of us could really learn a thing or two from these players regarding connection and unity.</p>
                <p class="ability desc ab4">Because of this tournament, I am more motivated to play the game again and improve teambuilding and teamwork with my other friends and other people.</p>

                    The DOST Family Feud is another event held during Hiabalag Season on August 26, 2023, 3:00 PM at the Hibalag grounds. In this event, different students from any course in Silliman University battle it out in a quizbee that works just like Family Feud with questions relating to school, college, Silliman and more. I was able to still watch most of the entirety of the event and be a part of the audience but some of us viewers had to watch from within shelter or shade cuz the ground was muddy and it was drizzling so we could only watch the event from afar.

                <p class="ans answer2">
                    The event was very intriguing as its questions were interesting and they made me think very hard as well. While I was watching the event, I was also surprised by the fact that some of my friends that are in the same batch and college as me also decided to join and participate in the sport. The highlight of the event were definitely the final rounds as it was getting intense but I also had to be excused for practices and other matters I had to go to.

                <p class="ans answer3">
                    The event gave me a lot of insights about its questions and results as it can teach you about a lot of things you may not know about on different topics and how people think differently and have varying preferences on certain situations. The activity also supported and gave importance to teamwork a lot as the participants have to play in teams as they answer the questions and score their best.

                            The SCUAA Football Match is a football competition between universities organized by the State College University Athletic Association or SCUAA on September 13, 2023, at the Cimafranca Ballfield of Sillima University. Football, or most commonly called as soccer on other places, is a sport played on an open field with two teams that will try to aim and hit the ball onto the opposing goal to score a point. Usually, passing, stealing, guiding, hitting and shooting the ball is through kicking and footwork but hitting the ball with the chest and the head is also allowed in the sport.

                            The competition was great and overall intriguing as there were a lot of clutch portions and close shots that made the event all the more tense and exciting which made me enjoy the activity a lot. The activity surprised me at first when I saw that the players are trained and supported to hit the ball with their heads and they even practice by passing the ball with their heads as their training from time to time.

                            When I got to watch the competition, the match was already in favor of a team that got very great teamwork and cooperation as their coordination with one another was satisfying to see. Unfortunately, it was hard to admit that the only reason why they're ahead a lot in the competition was because the opposing team had very weak teamwork as I have observed and as I see this contrast of team synergies, it taught me the importance of teamwork more and more.

                    The NORSU Karate Competition is a karate match organized by the Negros Oriental State University or NORSU on October 22, 2023, 9:00 AM at the NORSU Gymnasium. The goal of this event is to empower and enhance the participants' karate prowess and how they perform it towards or against their peers. Even though I am not a student of NORSU, I was still able to watch this competition and watch the participants train their best.

Even though they grow tired, I can still see their perseverance and determination which is a great representation of their sheer will. If there was a chance I could watch another karate match while some of the participants are still practicing, I would take that opportunity.

                                The SHS Pasiklaban Basketball Match is a basketball competition organized by the Senior High School department of Silliman University and it was held on November 8, 2023, 2:00 PM at the Alaska Court beside the Cimafranca Ballfield. Basketball is a sport where two teams dribble, pass and fight over a ball that they could use to score a point using the opposing team's hoop or basket. Even though I'm no longer senior highschool, I was still able to watch the sport as it was open to everyone and I even had a very clear view of everything.

                                The event surpassed my expectations as it was a very fun, exciting, energetic and competitive match. The match even surprised me when I learned that my past CFFS Teacher was the one who was doing the commentating and It shocked me as I didn't expect him to like basketball and knowledable about its rules. He was also one of the highlights in the competition because of how he made funny remarks and comments over the entire match.

                                The event gave back my interest in basketball because I lost interest to it back then after the pandemic but after seeing the senior high school students do their best in the basketball match and showcase their sportsmanship and reflexes, it inspired me and intrigued me to watch more matches like these. I would definitely watch other matches like these again just to have fun and immerse myself onto the match.

                    The CCS Volleyball Tryouts Match is a match organized by the College of Computer Studies to test CCS students as they try their best in a volleyball match to be included in the College of Computer Studies Volleyball team for the Silliman University Intramurals that is yet to come. It occurred on November 10, 2023, around 4:00 PM at the Ravello Field where the volleyball nets are located. I was just there as a spectator to support for my fellow CCS freshmen friends in the match, as I couldn't join them because I am not good at the sport.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The match was successful and it was very interesting as it was able to give me a taste and a sight of a very tense volleyball match and a very lengthy one as well. The best parts of the match were the different moments where my friends were still able to receive and pass the ball on very close moments and difficult times.

                    The competition taught me about the different roles and positions my friends had to take in each team like the setter, serving player, spiker and more. I also gained learnings about its mechanics and specifications that help drive the game. It also gave me a realization that this sport is very skill demanding and it can be very challenging for beginners but it doesn't stop me from watching the match.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this tryouts match, I am able to learn more about volleyball and would want to try it out myself in the future when the time is right.
